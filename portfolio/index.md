### Writhlington Orchid Project

I've been working with the Writhlington Orchid Project for almost as long as I've worked with the web. The Writhington Orchid Project required a website which they could use to keep those who support the project up to date with the latest news and information.  

Further, as one of the largest micropropergation labs in the world, they needed a way to provide people with the vast amounts of information about the orchids they work they have to offer. In order to do this they needed a site that could be easily updated by any member of the project without any training. 

As if this wasn't enough the project does several international exploration and educational trips every year. As a result they needed to be able to update the site from low-bandwidth connections on mobile devices. As a result of all of this the site makes use of the WordPress platform along with some of the latest HTML5 and CSS3 techniques to ensure it is accessible on mobile devices. 

Thanks to the WordPress platform the team can update the site via email and mobile applications from anywhere in the world and schedule posts to go live during UK hours, when the majory of the users are online. 

### Human Computer Interaction work

Human Computer Interaction is a university module which focuses primerily on userbility, ensuring that people or any abilities or ages can use systems with no or little training. For this module I had to design a new navigational station for an airport which could be used in a similar way to the current electronic information points. 

In order to do this I chose to break down the main objectives that the user may have, and then present each of these on an easiliy accessibile interface. Each screen would have an easy-to-use interface which allows the user to quickly navigation through the system in order to find the information they require, weather rushing to catch a flight or killing time while waiting for an arrival. 

### AppFlow

AppFlow was a website to help Mac users optimse their workflow by taking advatage of third party applications as well as built in applications. Due to other commitments I recently decided to close thos project down, despite it's recent redesign. 

The new design for AppFlow was designed to put content first and to amek it as easy as possible for users to navigate around the site. The branding was also refreashed to give it a much cleaner and more modern feeling look. 

### UoP Cycling

Univerity of Plymouth Cycling is a student run club for cycling enthusiasts of all disaplins. The website for the society aims to provide freashers at Plymouth University with all the information they need to see how active the club is and to find out how to join. 

### CoCamp

CoCamp was a group based coursework assignment based around CoCamp as a case study. The brief was to develop a system where the CoCamp event could be co-ordinated. Organisers could sign up for an account, add their event to the system and order all the required catering by adding their recipes and using those of other members. This project was completed with [Michael Wade](http://spikewade.biz/ "The Website of Micheal Wade") and [Nathan Davies](http://nathandavies.co.uk "The Website of Nathan Davies").

### Design Processes

Design Processes was a second year university module that looked at how to go about design. For the module the brief was to build a simple game using a platform such as [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com "Stencyl Game Maker") and document the design process as we went.  We'd then be marked on a mixture of the doucmentation for out process and the final game. 

I documented the game in the form a blog with several posts:
- [Game Concept](/notebook/2012/03/game-concept/  "Design Process: Game Concept")
- [Character Design](/notebook/2012/03/character-design/ "Design process: Character Design")
- [Level Design](/notebook/2012/03/level-design/ "Design Process: Level Design")
- [Level Creation](/notebook/2012/03/level-creation/ "Design Process: Level Creation")
- [Stitching Levels Together](/notebook/2012/03/stitching-levels-together/ "Design Process: Stitching Levels Together")
- [Menu Screens](/notebook/2012/03/menu-screens/ "Design Process: Menu Screens")
- [Project Completion](/notebook/2012/03/project-completion/ "Design Process: Project Completion")
