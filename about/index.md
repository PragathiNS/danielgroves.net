title: About Me
---

I am a Web Applications Development student who is currently studying at the University of Plymouth, where I am on the committee for the [University of Plymouth Cycling Club](http://uopcycling.co.uk/), and a member of [TermiSoc](http://termisoc.org/).

During my free time I like to play with bikes, take photos and design websites. My main project is currently [AppFlow](http://appflow.co.uk/).
