If everything has gone to plan round about now I should be finishing a talk on [Google Chromecast][chromecast] at [Plymouth JS][plymouth_js]. With a bit of luck it wasn't a disaster and people enjoyed it. We'll see.

To tie things together I thought it would be good to make the slides available and demo source code available. [The demo source code is on GitHub][github_repo], and the `readme` should contain everything needed to get started.
