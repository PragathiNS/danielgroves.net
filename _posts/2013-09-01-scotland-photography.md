excerpt: "A small selection of photographs from my summer holiday to Scotland"
---

Those of you who know me in person are probably aware that I spent two weeks in Scotland over the summer. When I'm at home I never feel like I have a huge amount of time to get the big camera out, there is far too many other thing going on to distract me. Going on holiday a great for this, it gives me a chance to blow the dust of an embark in something I always enjoy. 

I went went for the final weeks of July, returning home in the first few days of August, and almost a month later I've finally finished compiling a collection of my favourite shots from the holiday.  Although most of these have had minimal editing they are all reasonably close to how they were taken. What modifications that have been made a minor, and were done with the intent of helping the images gain more of the atmosphere from the time they were taken. 

### Photos

The first place we stayed was on a small campsite near Loch Morlich below the Glengorm mountain range, just outside Avimore.

After out stay in the Glengorms we moved to Glencoe, another area of outstanding scenery close to Fort William and the slopes of Scotland highest mountain, Ben Nevis. Here my most successful shots focus on the Loch Kinlochleven.

On the return home to South-West England we decided to break the journey for a few days in the Lake District.
