This morning I was playing in Photoshop, trying to get used to designing in it again, as for a long time now I have been using Fireworks.  So, I have create two clean and minimal buttons, one for uploading files and the other for downloads.  

[caption id="attachment_313" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Upload Button"]<img src="http://danielgroves.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/upload.png" alt="Upload Button" title="Upload Button" width="300" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-313" />[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_314" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Download Button"]<img src="http://danielgroves.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/download.png" alt="Download Button" title="Download Button" width="300" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-314" />[/caption]

Over at <a href="http://forrst.com/people/danielgroves/" target="_blank">Forrst</a> I promised that I would make them available for download for anyone who wants them.  Before downloading I want to make the following clear, by downloading them you are agreeing to these terms:

<h3 class="section"><strong>You Must</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Post a link to where they are in use in the comment section below</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section"><strong>I would like it if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Link back to this page so others know where to find the buttons</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section"><strong>You Can:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use these freely on any non-profit project or webpage</li>
	<li>Modify the download</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section"><strong>You Cannot:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Distribute these icons</li>
	<li>Use these icons without written permission from me on a profitable website.  This includes product sales, advertising revenue, or business promotion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Download &amp; Conclusion</h3>

Anyway, thats the boring bit over, so if you agree, feel free to <a href="http://playground.daniel-groves.co.uk/Photoshop-Buttons/" target="_blank">download</a> the buttons ((The reason I'm not using these buttons here is as to not create confusion, and because I have something a little different under production)).  

What do you think of them?  Any tips?  Please leave them in the comment below.
