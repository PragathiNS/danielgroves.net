excerpt: A insight into taking notes in the cloud in order to support working between multiple devices without any manual labour. 
---
<p>If you look back ten years ago most people wouldn't have had a tablet or a smartphone. Most would have just owned a single household computer. It was simple back then; you would write something, decide if you want to keep it, and the save it.</p>

<p>But that was ten years ago. Now it isn't all uncommon to own a smartphone, tablet, laptop and a desktop. We're living in a completely different age, where technology rules everything we do.</p>


<p>If you only have two devices its simple enough to copy your files backwards and forwards as they change to keep them in sync but for those of us with more than this we really do need to up the game.</p>


<p>I was late to the tablet game, and so only had a laptop until April gone, which I used for everything. Since I got my iPad I've been trying to keep as much as possible automatically synchronised between devices. With a new desktop on the way this is going to be more important than ever.</p>


<p>Thankfully, it's not just our devices that have updated over time; cloud-based software has crept in as well. Cloud software is now so common that most people are using it everyday without even noticing, and Evernote is one of the many pieces of software available which now make use of this cloud technology. </p>
	
<h3>What is Evernote?</h3>

<p>Evernote is a note-taking application and has been an essential application for me since getting my iPad. It takes advantage of the latest cloud-based technology meaning that it will push your notes to the Evernote's servers when you save them, and automatically download when your other devices come online. This may sound simple, but not all that long ago this simply wasn't possible.</p>

<p>Other services exist that also do this be Evernote has to be the most powerful of these with full support for rich-text editing, PDF embedding, image embedding, and multiple notebooks. Best of all, you can get started with as basic account for free and upgrade when you feel these need for the premium features.</p>


<p>The Evernote team have recently overhauled their web, mac and iOS user interfaces making it easier than ever to take notes on the move and keep the latest copies on all of your devices. Synchronisation is bi-directional as well meaning you can have “new” notes on all of your devices and Evernote will automatically determine which devices have the latest copies, and use this as the new copy.</p>
	
<h3>An Evernote Workflow</h3>

<p>The possibilities are truly endless with Evernote; it is now a part of my daily life as I take university notes on my iPad using Evernote knowing that they will be safely backed up instantly so I won't need to worry about loosing my data of my iPad is stolen. This is an ideal setup, which could be adapted for many people by simply subsidising "university" with "meeting" or "conference".</p>


<p>Why do I work like this when I could use a notebook and pen? Simple, I don't like having paper lying around. Paper uses space, gets creased is heavy and shows how bad my hand writing can be. It's also awkward when I find out something new and want to quickly update some notes with I just happened to have left on my desk at home.</p>

<p>Using Evernote I can walk around campus talking to a course mate, updating my notes with ideas on my phone and then get my iPad out in a lecture allowing me to quickly jot down notes from the lecture. When I get home I can bring these up on my computer making them quick and easy to access without even having to think about what I'm doing.</p>
	
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I've barly touched the surface of what Evernote can do today, and with support for Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows phone and a web interface it's sure to support your platform. It's fast, feature-rich and probably the best note-taking application on the market.</p>


<p>How do you use Evernote? Would you recommend an alternative?</p>
