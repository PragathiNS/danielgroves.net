It's not very often that I get any issues at all with my MacBook, let alone an issue this bad. I can't actually remember the last time I had a major issue, but given my MacBook is now well out of warranty the last thing I am going to do is take it near a Genius bar and risk having pay out loads of money I don't have.

After a reboot earlier today it came as a surprise then when the bluetooth icon in the menubar as a zigzagged line through it, providing the following information when clicking on it "Bluetooth: Not Available".

During the reboot my system appeared to freeze, just before the login screen appeared so, after a while of waiting, I resulted to force it to reboot. This time it booted fine, except for the bluetooth error.

After a little Googling I found an <a title="Mac bluetooth not available after power outage" href="http://bjhess.com/blog/mac_bluetooth_not_available_after_power_outage/" target="_blank">article by Barry Hess</a> about a similar issue caused by a power cut.

Unfortunately for me his solution didn't work, but I had an idea which, for now, appears to have worked. What I proceeded to do was to <a title="Resetting the PRAM on your Mac" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379" target="_blank">reset the PRAM</a> on my Mac. To do this you simply reboot while holding ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R. Once you hear the chime of your Mac restarting the process is complete, you can simply release the keys to resume a normal start-up.

I have published these finding here with the hope that someone will find them useful, or perhaps I may require them again one day in the future.

<h3>Update 23/01/2012</h3>
This issue occurred again today, and this time none of the steps outlined here would work in order to fix the issue. After more research and trail and error exercises, I found that <a title="Reset the SMC on an Intel Mac" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964" target="_blank">resetting the SMC</a> in an intel based Mac is another common solution, and worked for me on this occasion.
