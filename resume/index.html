<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>As a developer I like to keep work agile. I use Git for version control, making it easy to collaborate with large teams of other developers. I regularly write unit tests for applications, often working to the test driven development methodology. This allows for easy automated testing of software to ensure that changes in the future to not break anything. I will often run these on a continuous integration server. When developing larger application I prefer to use a web framework, as this provides the scaffolding for the project and saves on development time. </p>

<p>When designing I work directly in the browser. This allows designs to be developed quickly whilst showing the full dimension of of a design from desktop all the way through to mobile, something missed by graphical representations. In the past I have worked in Adobde Fireworks and Photoshop to produce site mockups and Adobe Dreamweaver to produce finished products, although I prefer to hand-code sites as it provides more flexibility and more options for incorporating new technologies. </p>

<p>When FTP is required I use Transmit on Macs, or FileZilla on any other platform, while coding my editor of choice is Sublime Text or TextMate, although I am open to almost anything. During my first year at university I used Flash in order to produce a game.</p>

<h3>Interests/Activities</h3>
<p>I have a large range of activities that I partake in on a regular basis. I have previously been the representative for the University of Plymouth Cycling Club, where I organised weekly rides or varying length and difficulty, often out onto Dartmoor. I am also an active climber and spend a lot of time at the Bristol Climbing centre when back at home. I am a frequent visitor to areas such as the Lake District where I partake in activities such as backpacking, hiking and camping.</p>
<p>Wherever I am it is common to see me out with my D-SLR, I am a huge fan of photography, using it as a lone hobby when doing shots such as landscapes or combined with other hobbies, for example I often take my camera mountain biking.</p>
<p>On top of this I am constantly on-line developing my presence through web design. Other hobbies include reading, listening to music and watching DVDs. I was a member of the Air Training Corps for four years.</p>
