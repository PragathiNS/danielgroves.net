This page was inspired by the [/now](now_movement). The idea here is to maintain a /now page which explains what you're working on right now.

I'm currently based in Plymouth, and I have shifted my primary focus towards:

* **Photography**: I'm trying to push my photography forward with a view to selling prints.
* **Adventures**: I love getting out and seeing the world, so I'm [focusing on lots of microadventures](adventures_photography) with bigger ones in the pipeline for the near future.
* **Big Adventure**: I'm actively planning a big [adventure](adventures_photography) for next summer.
* **Reading**: I love books, so I'm reading as many as I can.
* **Writing**: I'm trying to write new and fresh content for this website. It's grown a little too stale for my liking in certain areas, so I'd like to get more frequent content rolling forward.
* **Code**: I'm working on two project, both of which will be open-sourced in the near future. More details comencing soon.
