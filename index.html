        <h1>Photographer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I am a photographer who spends as much time shooting and editing photographs as breathing. I primarily work with travel &amp; landscape, but have been known to dabble in action–sport and street photography in the past. </p>
      <p>I go on regular microadventures in order to access remote locations to photograph. These are often grueling exercises in some bad conditions all for one shot - <em>if</em> the light is right. </p>

        <h1>Developer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I develop clean and maintainable code for my own projects and my employer. I work in a number of languages including C#, Python and Ruby, and have experience with web frameworks such as Django and ASP.net.</p>
      <p>I regularly share what I am working on through my GitHub profile, for example you can find the source-code for this website in it's <a href="http://github.com/danielgroves/danielgroves.net" title="Source code for danielgroves.net">open–source repository</a>. </p>

        <h1>Writer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I try to use writing as a means of supporting my photography. Words can often help to tell the story around photographs of what was required to get on-site for an image. </p>
      <p>I try to tell the stories of the more dramatic events, something which is often hard to find time for after pouring hours into image processing. What I do write is published in my <a href="/adventures-photography" title="Tales of adventures for photographic results">adventures and photography</a> section. </p>
