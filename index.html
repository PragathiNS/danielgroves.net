		<h2>Design</h2>
		<div class="wrap">
			<p>Clean and minimal design which puts the content first is a clear way to sell a product or brand. By keeping the design simple it appeals to a large audience while making it clear and easy for a user to find their way around the site. </p>
			<p>When designing I work with; Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, HTML5 and CSS3, and add interactive features using either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. For all of my recent projects I have ensured mobile support by implementing responsive design. </p>

		<h2>Code</h2>
		<div class="wrap">
			<p>All my code is clean, maintainable and object-orientated. This helps to future-proof work so that code is easily expandable, efficent and maintainable. I can work with a number of languages including; PHP, Java, C# and ActionScript 3.</p>
			<p>I use GIT for version control in all of my project to ensure that it is easily to collaborate with other developers, experiment with features and roll-back changes. </p>
