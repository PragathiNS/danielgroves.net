        <h1>Photographer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I am a photographer who spends as much time shooting and editing photographs as breathing. I primerily work with travel &amp; landscape, but have been known to dabble in action–sport and street photography in the past. </p>
      <p>I use photography as a means to support my writing and to help encourage adventure which I regularly write about in the <em><a href="/adventures-photography" title="Adventures and Photography Writing">adventures and photography</a></em> section. </p>

        <h1>Developer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I develop clean and maintainable code for my own projects and my employer. I work in a number of languages including C#, Python and Ruby, and have experience with web frameworks such as Django and ASP.net.</p>
      <p>I regularly share what I am working on through my GitHub profile, for example you can find the source-code for this website in it's <a href="http://github.com/danielgroves/danielgroves.net" title="Source code for danielgroves.net">open–source repsoitory</a>. </p>

        <h1>Writer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Despite being a photographer in my personal time, I try to set time aside to write about the adventures I go on to achieve an image. These are often grueling exercises in some bad conditions all for one shot - <em>if</em> the light is right. </p>
      <p>For the more eventful trips I write about what happened, and try to share the story with readers from my own eyes, for example you can read about my Jophn O' Groats to Lands End cycle last year in its <a href="/adventures-photography/2014/11/JOGLE/" title="John O' Groats to Lands End - Part One">two–part</a> <a href="/adventures-photography/2014/12/JOGLE-2/" title="John O' Groats to Lands End - Part Two">blog</a>. </p>
