		<h2>Design</h2>
		<div class="wrap">
			<p>Clean and minimal design which puts the content first in a clear way helps to sell a product or brand. By keeping the design simple it appeals to a large audience while making it clear and easy for a user to find their way around the site. </p>
			<p>I work with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to develop responsive designs in the browser. This way you can see how the finished product will look and behave, this prevents you having a static product with a poor experience whilst saving you money. </p>

		<h2>Code</h2>
		<div class="wrap">
			<p>All code is clean, maintainable and object-oriented. This helps to future-proof work so that code is easily expandable, efficient and maintainable. I can work with a number of languages including Python, Java, PHP, and C#.</p>
			<p>I use GIT for version control in all of my projects to ensure that it is easily to collaborate with other developers, experiment new with features and control changes. </p>
