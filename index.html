      <p>I develop clean and maintainable code for my own personal projects, open-source contributions, and my employer. </p>
      <p>I work in a number of languages including C#, Python, Ruby and Java. I have experience with web frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails and ASP.net.</p>
      <p>I use GIT for version control in all of my projects to ensure that it is easily to collaborate with other developers, experiment new with features and control changes.</p>

      <p>Although primerily a landscape photosgrapher, I have also been known to dabble in street and action-sport photography. </p>
      <p>In order to help push my photography to the next level I am working to complete a <a href="/photo365" title="Photo365 challenge attempt">Photo365 challenge</a> over 2015. </p>

        <h1>Writer</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Despite spending much of my time writing code and taking photographs I frequently set time aside to read and write. After any significant adventure or photoshoot I tend to docuemnt them on my <em>adventures and photography</em> page. </p>
      <p>I also regularly write about technical challenges and projects on which I have embarked in attempt to document things for my own future reference, as well as with the small chance that they will aid somebody else. </p>
