Something I've seen flying around the world of the web over the last week or so is the Give and Tell Challenge. I first saw this on Andy Clarke's website, Stuff and Nonsense. It's a challenge pitched as an alternative to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge which supports more than just the one charity. 

The problem with the ice bucket challenge is it has a narrow scope, thus only support the one charity. This is fantastic for ALS, very few people had even heard of them before the challenge. Despite this, their are other charities which need the attention. The further problem is the volume of people who do the challenge (great for raising awareness), but fail to give. [Paul Boag phrased it much better in his own post](pb):

> But here is the thing, people stop at the challenge. That is not the fault of the campaign, it’s the result of human nature. We see it as a bit of a laugh, the latest shiny thing. But it doesn’t change our long term behaviour. It doesn’t get us to think about what we are giving to and why. That is why I was dreading getting called out.

The *Give and Tell Challenge* aims to get around that. The requirements are clearly set out for it: 

> The “Give and Tell Challenge.’ You donate to a cause, or causes, that have meaning to you and you say why. You then challenge 3 other people to do the same thing.
