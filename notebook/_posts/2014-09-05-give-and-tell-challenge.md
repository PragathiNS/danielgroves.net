excerpt: "Raising awareness for charities beyond ALS"

Something I've seen flying around the world of the web over the last week or so is the Give and Tell Challenge. I first saw this on Andy Clarke's website, Stuff and Nonsense. It's a challenge pitched as an alternative to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge which supports more than just the one charity.

The problem with the ice bucket challenge is it has a narrow scope, thus only support the one charity. This is fantastic for ALS, very few people had even heard of them before the challenge. Despite this, their are other charities which need the attention. The further problem is the volume of people who do the challenge (great for raising awareness), but fail to give. [Paul Boag phrased it much better in his own post](pb):

> But here is the thing, people stop at the challenge. That is not the fault of the campaign, it’s the result of human nature. We see it as a bit of a laugh, the latest shiny thing. But it doesn’t change our long term behaviour. It doesn’t get us to think about what we are giving to and why. That is why I was dreading getting called out.

The *Give and Tell Challenge* aims to get around that. The requirements are clearly set out for it:

> The “Give and Tell Challenge.’ You donate to a cause, or causes, that have meaning to you and you say why. You then challenge 3 other people to do the same thing.

## Charity: Mountain Rescue UK

One charity that is often under-valued in their efforts, and on many occasions outright abused, is the mountain rescue. For me, and many of my friends and family, their efforts are both valiant and crucial. A one of many people who loves to spend far to much time outside they're an important organisation in the UK. Despite this they're mostly volunteer staffed and mostly donation funded.

To give an idea of just how many the mountain rescue helps, and how bug an impact they make on some individuals lives, just take a look at [the news column on Grough](grough) (outdoor news website). At the time of writing thirteen of the eighteen news pieces feature the mountain rescue. That's just over 72%.

As someone who lovers spending time outdoors, weather it's in the Scottish Highlands, on Dartmoor, or in the lake district, the Mountain Rescue is one organisation I always have and always will support. I can only hope that I will never need their assistance though.

## Nominees

The next part of the *Give and Tell Challenge* is to get more people involved. This requires nominating three more people to write about a charity they want to support, why, and to donate. For this, I have chosen
