Those of you who know me in person are probably aware that I spent two weeks in Scotland over the summer. When I'm at home I never feel like I have a huge amount of time to get the big camera out, there are far too many other things going on to distract me. Going on holiday is great for this, it gives me a chance to blow the dust off the SLR and embark on something I always enjoy. 

I went for the final weeks of July, returning home in the first few days of August, and almost a month later I've finally finished compiling a collection of my favourite shots from the holiday.  Although most of these have had minimal editing they are all reasonably close to how they were taken. The modifications that have been made are minor, and were done with the intent of helping the images gain more of the atmosphere from the time they were taken. 

### Photos

The first place we stayed was on a small campsite near Loch Morlich below the Cairngorm mountain range, just outside Aviemore.

After out stay in the Cairngorms we moved to Glencoe; another area of outstanding scenery. It's close to Fort William at the base of the slopes of Scotlands highest mountain, Ben Nevis. Here my most successful shots focus on the Loch Leven.

On the return home to the southwest we decided to break the journey for a few days in the Lake District.
