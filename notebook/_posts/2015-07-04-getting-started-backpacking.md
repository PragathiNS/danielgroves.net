Much of the photography work I do is in the more remote regions of Dartmoor. Although, as a relatively small area, is is possible to walk in, do a shoot, and walk out with Dartmoor, it's normally impractical. This is the case even more so when shooting at sunrise and/or sunset.

With this has come interest from some of those I know, as well as others, as to what gear you *actually* need, what is advisable, and what you can do without. If you have no interest in gear, I suggest you skip this post and go and read something of more interest.

When you're first getting started it can be hard to know where you can save some pennies and where it's important to get good kit. Throughout this post I'll try and recommend the best places to save money where you won't loose comfort. I'll show you what gear I use, and a few suitable alternatives that are cheaper.

## Shelter and Sleeping

The first and most important thing while backpacking is your shelter and sleeping arrangements. These will keep you warm and dry should the weather turn to the worst, but should be too big or heavy as to be impractical to carry.

Starting with your tent, you should be looking for a stable tent with a good hydrostatic head (this is how we measure how waterproof they are). There is loads of advice online about different tents, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you're not sure. I minimal hydrostatic head for UK conditions should be around 3000, with a floor of around 8000 to ensure nothing will seep in if the ground is saturated.

You should choose your sleeping bag based on the time of year you intend to go camping, and weather or not you're a cold sleeper. If in doubt, buy something warmer. You can always undo the zip to vent some heat, but it's hard to stay warm if you buy too cold a sleeping bag.

With sleeping bags you should also consider the material. A down bag will be warmer, lighter and pack smaller but once wet will not keep you warm at all. A Synthetic bag is the opposite to this; not quite as warm, bigger and heavier but will keep you warm even when wet through. Personally I use a down bag, and keep it in a dry bag. It only ever comes out of the dry-bag once it's in my tent so I know it will stay dry.

Once you have a sleeping bag you need something to sleep on. Some people choose to go without, however if you're new to this you're probably going to want to do everything you can to ensure you're comfortable and maximise enjoyment. A good comfortable nights sleep is key to this. You could use an old foam roll matt, these are cheap but only provide minimal insulation benefits and take up a lot of room. A modern inflatable mat is a much better choice which can be picked up surprisingly cheaply.

This is a good place to skimp. You can pickup an inflatable pillow for as little as £10. However, many people go cheaper still! You could stuff a dry-bag with spare clothing such as a down jacket or your day clothes and use this instead.

## Eating and Cooking

None of us want to go hungry. You could take cold food with you to help cut-down on pack size and pack-weight, but nothing beats a hot meal and drink at the end of the day. You want to keep food simple… dehydrated or easily reheat-able food is best as it takes minimal cooking times and packs down small. Wayfarers boil-in-the-bag meals are ideal for a starter, but similar meals can be made for much less by raiding your local supermarket and thinking outside of the box.

Once you've chosen some food, you'll be in need of a cooker on which to cook it. There are numerous options available from homemade jobs all the way through to full-blown expedition stoves. You probably want something in the middle so you can be sure of its reliability, efficiency and that it'll have enough power to cook your dinner if the weather turns bad. Thankfully, there are plenty of options depending on your budget and weight targets.

* [MSR Pocket Rocket][stove_msr_poket_rocket]

Make sure you've got enough of the correct fuel for your cooker. You'll easily get a few trips out of a small 150g gas canister, or the smallest available bottle if you've chosen a multi-fuel stove.

If you've chosen to buy into a cooker, not a stove system (an all-inclusive unit, such as the JeBoil or Brukit listed above), then you'll need some pans. Look for something small and light-weigh with a lid that has a detachable handle. I use a small 1.5l MSR pan, but anything will do. If you want to save some pennies, this is a smart place to do so.

Don't forget a mug, spork, and the drinks of your choice either. I often take fruit-tea with me as it weighs nothing, packs down small, and the bags can easily be thrown in with the rest of your rubbish when you're done with them.

Throughout the day you're going to need snacks. Cliff bars are perfect, but expensive. I tend to take trail mix made of up a cheap bag of assorted nuts from the supermarket, with some dried fruit and chocolate piece thrown in. This gives you a good mix of instant-energy while providing some good long-lasting energy at the same time.

## Clothing

The first thing to think about is boots. If you're reading this you've probably been enjoying day-walks for long enough to already have a set, but if not go down to your local outdoor shop and talk to someone. You want something that's not too heavy, is waterproof, and well made. Over all of that they *must* fit properly. Any movement will turn into friction burns which is how you get blisters, and thats going to be the last thing you want. Try on as many pairs as you can within your budget (£100 is a good amount to put towards boots) and choose the pair that fits best. If they are eVent or GoreTex that's even better, having something which breaths and is waterproof will make your feet much more comfortable.

Secondly, socks make a big difference. I use a mix of the Bridgedale Trail and Summit series depending on where I'm walking and what time of year it is. Socks support your feet and help to fill excess volume in the boot, reducing the risk of blisters further. They also help wick sweat away from your feet and keep the both cool and dry as a result. There are other brands available, ask the sales assistant while you're buying your boots. While you're there, it's worth getting a second pair to take as spares. If you manage to submerge your foot in a bog or to the bottom of a river you'll be grateful for a change of socks.

Think about what spare layers you take carefully, but don't over-do it. So many people pack way more layers than they'll actually need. Remember, when you're out in the mountains for a day walk you have to take into account what happens if you hurt yourself. While backpacking you do have a sleeping bag and tent with you, worst case you can get in your sleeping bag and wrap your tent around yourself. It's not ideal, but you do have that as an emergency option, so only take what you think you'll actually need.

Never leave your waterproofs behind, both jacket and trousers should be considered mandatory as you never know how the weather will change over the hours, let alone over a whole night. On top of this, remember it can get cold at night even in the summer. Always pack a hat and gloves, even if they're lightweight options.

Your tshirt, fleeces, and trousers should all be lightweight breathable options. You don't want anything that won't retain warmth if it gets wet, and doesn't let sweat out properly.

## Safety, Hygiene and Personal

The most important thing here is a map and a compass. Keep your map in something waterproof (the Ortlieb map bags are perfect) and get a good-quality compass with a clear backing.

You're going to be out overnight, so make sure you have a torch. A head-torch is best to keep your hands free and make sure you have some spare batteries. You never know when you may find yourself needing to venture out of your tent at night. You should be taking a basic first-aid kit too. I always ensure mine has the following:

* Paracetamol
* Ibuprofen
* Savlon
* Platers
* Small Scissors
* Small tweezers (for tick removal)
* Water purification tablets
* Spare contact lenses

That should cover the basics, but ensure you take any personal medication that you know you're likely to need (thing like inhalers are easily forgotten). It can be worth taking hand-sanitising gel (especiually if you use contact lenses) or hand-wipes for general hygiene around toilet use and cooking while out.

Other items I include are:

* [Leatherman][leatherman_wave]
* Headphones
* Book

## Summary

Buying the initial kit may be expensive, but there is a fair chance you;ve already got a lot of what you need at home, especially if you;ve been doing day walks or camping casually for a while. If you already have gear, re-use it; there is little point in spending money on new gear unless you know you'll enjoy using it regularly. It is worth considering if your tent will keep your dry and sheltered above all else, this is the last place I would ever choose to cut corners.

With sensible gear choices you're pack should be manageable and you should be able to stay warm and dry throughout the trip - this is essential to enjoying it. Now, once you ahve your kit, drop your sleeping bag and spare clothes into a couple of dry bags, throw it all in your rucksack, and get out there.
