Much of the photography work I do is in the more remote regions of Dartmoor. Although, as a relatively small area, is is possible to walk in, do a shoot, and walk out with Dartmoor, it's normally impractical. This is the case even more so when shooting at sunrise and/or sunset.

With this has come interest from some of those I know, as well as others, as to what gear you *actually* need, what is advisable, and what you can do without. If you have no interest in gear, I suggest you skip this post and go and read something of more interest.

## Shelter and Sleep

The first and most important thing while backpacking is your shelter and sleeping arrangements. These will keep you warm and dry should the weather turn to the worst, but should be too big or heavy as to be impractical to carry.
