Much of the photography work I do is in the more remote regions of Dartmoor. Although, as a relatively small area, is is possible to walk in, do a shoot, and walk out with Dartmoor, it's normally impractical. This is the case even more so when shooting at sunrise and/or sunset.

With this has come interest from some of those I know, as well as others, as to what gear you *actually* need, what is advisable, and what you can do without. If you have no interest in gear, I suggest you skip this post and go and read something of more interest.

When you're first getting started it can be hard to know where you can save some pennies and where it's important to get good kit. Throughout this post I'll try and recommend the best places to save money where you won't loose comfort. I'll show you what gear I use, and a few suitable alternatives that are cheaper.

## Shelter and Sleeping

The first and most important thing while backpacking is your shelter and sleeping arrangements. These will keep you warm and dry should the weather turn to the worst, but should be too big or heavy as to be impractical to carry.

Starting with your tent, you should be looking for a stable tent with a good hydrostatic head (this is how we measure how waterproof they are). There is loads of advice online about different tents, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you're not sure. I minimal hydrostatic head for UK conditions should be around 3000, with a floor of around 8000 to ensure nothing will seep in if the ground is saturated.

 * Wild Country Zepheses or whatever its called
 * Vango 250

You should choose your sleeping bag based on the time of year you intend to go camping, and weather or not you're a cold sleeper. If in doubt, buy something warmer. You can always undo the zip to vent some heat, but it's hard to stay warm if you buy too cold a sleeping bag.

With sleeping bags you should also consider the material. A down bag will be warmer, lighter and pack smaller but once wet will not keep you warm at all. A Synthetic bag is the opposite to this; not quite as warm, bigger and heavier but will keep you warm even when wet through. Personally I use a down bag, and keep it in a dry bag. It only ever comes out of the dry-bag once it's in my tent so I know it will stay dry.

 * Something inbetween?

Once you have a sleeping bag you need something to sleep on. Some people choose to go without, however if you're new to this you're probably going to want to do everything you can to ensure you're comfortable and maximise enjoyment. A good comfortable nights sleep is key to this. You could use an old foam roll matt, these are cheap but only provide minimal insulation benefits and take up a lot of room. A modern inflatable mat is a much better choice which can be picked up surprisingly cheaply.

* thermarest my-one
* couple of cheap ones

This is a good place to skimp. You can pickup an inflatable pillow for as little as Â£10. However, many people go cheaper still! You could stuff a dry-bag with spare clothing such as a down jacket or your day clothes and use this instead.
