Part of the attraction to mountain biking has always been the sense of adventure. Riding off-road trails in the middle of nowhere with some of your best mates can make for a good day, but every now and then it's good to push yourself. To try something new.

I set off late on my days adventure, but I figured it would be better to get up a little later having had a good nights sleep than to get up still tired; after all, the plan was to push for a 100km day on Dartmoor. Thankfully the bike was already to go, having prepared it the night before. After a quick breakfast I was in the saddle and pumping up towards the moor, pushing hard. I had intentionally fitted a triple chainring setup for this trip, knowing I was going to have to push for some fast average speeds whilst being aware I would struggle without a granny ring when I was getting exhausted later in the dat. This turned out to be a smart move.

The first 25km took me up to Burrator Reservoir in just 1:40, a pretty reasonable time. Getting the balance between speed and endurance is difficult on this sort of ride, not really having any idea off how long it will take, or when your body will finally become completely exhausted. At this point it was time to leave the tarmac as I began to push up the Eylesbarrow climb, still pushing hard.

On the approach to the climb it was clear that their was a large volume of traffic on it. A large group of backpackers were filling the area, which proved to make the climb more challenging than normal. The problem with overtaking large groups of people who don't ride mountain bikes themselves is they don't understand the concept of line choice, something which is crucial when on a technical climb. As a mountain biker I'm climbing, looking for the line of least resistance, the line that I am most likely to get up without wheel-spinning or running out of momentum. As backpackers, they're all just standing and staring; normally on the best line.

Good time was made getting up to Princetown, 2:30 from the front door all the way up. This was the end of the known ground as from here I would head for Venford reservoir along bridleways I'd only ever seen on the OS map. The pace slowed as I expected over the next sections as I entered unknown terrain and had to consult the map frequently to check where I was headed. Looking out towards the horizon it was clear that the weather was pretty foul, and getting worse, towards my destination. I stopped among a large area of rocks to try and decide if it was wise to continue in the direction; afterall there was a long way to go.

I made the decision to continue, taking the view that I could always bail out and road-ride back home, to Exeter for a train or to Ivybridge for a train. Thankfully, as the day progressed I managed to escape the majority of the rain, just get clipped by the occasional shower. Riding in the rain is never the most pleasant of experiences in exposed places, and this ride was particularly bas for exposure on the moorland.

Crossing the River Swincombe became an interesting exercise. I had chosen to cross at a certain point knowing that a footbridge was present, allowing it to be crossed without getting wet. However, on arrival, it turned out the bridge had been closed. A delicate exercise of hoping from stone-to-stone while pushing the bike through the river allowed me to make it over with only one mildly-damp foot.

Once over the river a fast road-blast through Hexworthy allowed fast time to be made to the Venford Reservoir, just a few hundred meters short of the half-way point.

After another spot of lunch the route plan was to pickup the *Two Moors Way* at Holne, and then stick to this until it intersected a small lane at *Brown Heath*. This next section proved to more challenging than any part of the ride so far, yet only a warm-up for what would come next.

Once again progress was fast heading to Chalk Ford (which would make for a rather nice wild camping spot at OS grid 681 685). However, past this progress slowed substantially. Moorland navigation can be hard and difficult at the best of times. Some areas are riddled with unmarked paths while other areas have marked paths that simply don't exist. In this case the area was riddled with plenty of unmarked paths, this is preferred as a quick bearing confirmed the direction in which I had to head from the top of the Chalk Ford climb, and progress was underway again. Unluckily for me, the ground was damp and this grassy and peaty soil can be extremely energy sapping in such a state.

Slow progress was made as I climbed to the top of the hill, but I was rewarded with a short but reasonably fast descent to *Bishops Mead*. This descent was made all the more interesting due to the wheel-sized holes in the ground which had to be dodged to avoid being turned into a human-catapult. Slowing down would have been the sensible optionâ€¦

After slower progress for about a kilometer along the river I found the bridge I was after as a crossing point, and pushed the bike over while a group of backpackers made their way down the horrendously steep climb on the other side that I'd have to push the bike up. This was far too steep to ride.

From this top section process was once again slow to the lane-intersection, with the ground barely being rideable. I had hoped that the ground would improve after the intersection, but this was where the ride proved to be harder than anywhere else.
