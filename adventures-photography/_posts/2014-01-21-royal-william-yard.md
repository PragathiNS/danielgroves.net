I headed over to the [Royal William Yard](http://www.royalwilliamyardharbour.co.uk/ "The Royal William Yard harbour") this morning for the Plymouth Agile Meetup. I threw the SLR in my bag on the off chance that the weather was good as I left, but was presented with quite a view on arrival. I can only wish I had the tripod with me at the time, and must make point of getting back over there soon.
