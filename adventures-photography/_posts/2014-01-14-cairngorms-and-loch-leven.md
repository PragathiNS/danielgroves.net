I recently decided that in order to motivate myself to both use the camera more, and get more of what I shoot "out there" I would start a camera roll. This is essentially a photo blog, something I have been considering starting for some time now.

In order to kick everything off, I thought I would start by sharing three images taken during the summer when I spent some time in the Cairngorms and stayed at the top of Loch Leven. These three have already been shared, along with others, in my post *[Scotland Photography](/notebook/2013/09/scotland-photography/ "Notebook entry on Photography in Scotland")*.

This was taken from the funicular railway car park looking up one of the ski slopes during the summer months; on first day of the two-week stay in Scotland. You can see snow on the slopes of Ben MacDui behind.

These next two images were both taken from the same place at the top of Loch Leven. They both show the scene in very different light as the afternoon progressed into the evening.
