# danielgroves.net Source

This is the source for the current version of my portfolio. This automatically pushed as I commit changes to the production branch. New features, content, and design changes are developed on private branches which are automatically pushed here when they are deployed.

My site has previously been a static site with no generator behind it and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress Publishing Platform") based.

## Build Status

[![build status](http://ci.danielgroves.net/projects/8/status.png?ref=master)](http://ci.danielgroves.net/projects/8?ref=master)

## Usage

Setting up and using the site is pretty easy. Make sure you have Ruby install, install the Jekyll gem and then run the server. Once you have Ruby installed:

```bash
gem install jekyll
gem install redcarpet
easy_install pygments
cd project/directory/
jekyll serve
```

Then simply go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
