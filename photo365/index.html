title: Photo365 Challenge
excerpt: "For 2014 I am attempting to do the photo365 challenge. This means publishing one photo every day for a year. For this challenge I have imposed no camera restrictions (either the SLR or iPhone camera can be used) and one photo must be submitted everyday."

<p class="easyread">Due the nature of many of the trips I do where I am unable to gain internet access some of these may be submitted a few days late, but all will have been taken on the correct day.</p>

<p class="easyread">The images are uploaded to <a href="http://instagram.com/danielsgroves/" title="Daniel Groves on Instagram" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and provided here by pulling those with the #photo365 hashtag from my personal feed. For immediate updates you can <a href="http://instagram.com/danielsgroves/" title="Daniel Groves on Instagram" target="_blank">follow me on Instagram</a>.</p>
