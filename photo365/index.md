excerpt: "An attempt at the Photo365 challenge."

For 2014 I am attempting to do the photo365 challenge. This means publishing one photo every day for a year. For this challenge I have imposed no camera restrictions (either the SLR or iPhone camera can be used) and one photo must be submitted everyday.

Due the nature of many of the trips I do where I am unable to gain internet access some of these may be submitted a few days late, but all will have been taken on the correct day.

The images are uploaded to [Instagram](http://instagram.com/danielsgroves/ "Daniel Groves on Instagram") and provided here by pulling those with the #photo365 hashtag from my personal feed. For immediate updates you can [follow me on Instagram](http://instagram.com/danielsgroves/ "Daniel Groves on Instagram").
